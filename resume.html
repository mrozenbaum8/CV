        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’m Moshe, Founder of <a href="https://www.icymedia.co">icyMedia</a>. I have produced marketing videos since 2011 and websites, graphic designs and google ads campaigns since 2016 for startups, non-profits, mom-and-pop businesses, multinational corporations and even former presidents Shimon Peres and Reuben Rivlin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before making <i>Aliyah</i>  to Jerusalem and founding icyMedia, I worked at CUDenver's cardiovascular pulmonary research lab as a Student Researcher in molecular imaging, where I provided <a href="./documents/Moshe's report.pdf">essential data</a> to obtain a $5 million DARPA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4130652/">research grant</a>, while combining my two passions: visual arts and science.
