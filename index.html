    <h2>
        Hello World!
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’m Moshe, founder of <a href="https://www.icymedia.co">icy.Media</a>. I have produced marketing videos since 2011 and websites, graphic designs and Google Ads campaigns since 2016 for startups, non-profits, mom-and-pop businesses, and multinational corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before starting icy.Media, I worked at the University of Colorado-Denver as a Student Researcher in molecular biology, where I provided essential data to obtain a $5M DARPA research grant and web programming, and where I was a course head for CS50, Harvard’s introductory course in computer science. I’ve also worked previously at Palantir and the National Speech and Debate Association.
